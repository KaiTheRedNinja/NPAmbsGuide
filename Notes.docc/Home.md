WELCOME TO NGEE ANNNNN! (very loud with frantically waving hands)

## Overview

I'm Kai, a Year 1 in Ngee Ann Polytechnic Ambassadors. 

This is a mirror of my private notes, containing only Ambassadors related information.

See [this link](https://www.np.edu.sg/student-life/clubs-societies/np-ambassadors) for more information about the Ngee Ann 
Polytechnic Ambassadors. Basically, we represent the school to the public, including prospective students, parents, and the
general public.

## Icon Key

- üîÑ: In Progress
- üìù: Theres the minimal amount of something there, and I'm not planning to elaborate on it any time soon
- üìÑ or something that looks like it: Not started (docc uses a custom icon that looks like that emoji's outline)
- ‚úÖ or anything else: Completed (I might use different icons for different subjects or topics)

## Disclaimer

I am in Group 2 (Ninjas) and the longest I will be in Ambassadors is from 2025 to 2027 (inclusive). If you are
reading this after 2027 or are from a different group, this information may not be accurate.
