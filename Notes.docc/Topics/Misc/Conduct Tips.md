Tips about when you're representing NP as an ambassador

## Overview

- When you compare between NP and another poly or JCs in general, try to
    - promote NP, but
    - DO NOT put down the other institution
- Use proper english
- DO NOT try and speak for JCs, esp when comparing
- If you are *not sure* about something, do NOT say something wrong. This will
dig yourself into a hole that will be difficult to get out of, or you may give
them incorrect information. You should:
    - tell them to check the NP website
    - refer to somebody else that knows
- Sound confident
- Share personal experiences
- If a student comes up to you with really vague questions, try probing more before
suggesting a diploma. Remember that CEPs are for when THEY don't know what THEY want,
not when YOU don't know what THEY want.
- Always mention that "it us up to you"
- Use positive language!
- NO TOUCHY.
- No stand-offish posture, eg. crossing arms
- When promoting something, start general (eg. how it benefits all NP students), then
"zoom in" (eg. how a specific course uses it), so you dont lose interest

Dos:
- Be professional
- Be friendly, KNOW YOUR LIMITS
- Be mindful of personal space
- If campers are inappropriate,
    - Stay calm and be professional
    - If marks are VERY offensive, direct talk to seniors/teachers
- SPEAK THE TRUTH
- Stand straight
- Use phones DISCRETELY

Don'ts:
- Use inappropriate language
- Lie
- Cross arms
- Slouch
- Stand on one leg
- Arms on hips
- Eat/drink (water is fine, face away from visitors)
- Scroll social media
- Play mobile games
