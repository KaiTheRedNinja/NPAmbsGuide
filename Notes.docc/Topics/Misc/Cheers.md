# Cheers

Take your self awareness and bury it where it will never again see the light of day

## Overview

There are 3 cheers for each of the 5 "tribes". I'm in Ninjas (group 2) so for now these notes will just contain theirs.

Also there are some actions, to be honest I've forgotten most of them. I'll write them down if we go through them again.

## Ninjas

### War Cry

```
Boys: OH oooo OH oooo OH
Girls: Oh-o-OH (x2)
All: Ninjas power power (×3)
All: Oh my gosh (gay wrist flick)
All: Ninjas power power (×3, louder)
All: one last time! Ninjas power power (x3, loudest) 
All: Suah, hiak! (ninja crane pose)
```

### Circle Circle Dot Dot

```
All: Circle circle dot dot (draw in the air like ⊙ ⊙) Uh huh (nod)
All: I got my selfie shot (hold imaginary phone up in selfie pose)
All: Uh huh you think that tribe is hot (point to another tribe)
All: Uh huh I think I'd rather not (x-arms)
Girls: Ok?
Boys: Alright!
All: Ok Ninjas let's go!
All: Strong and so awesome, we are so hip
All: We think your tribe IS FULL OF (increasingly loud), 
All: Shift to the left and shift to the right (softer)
All: Ninjas Ninjas fight fight fight!
```
