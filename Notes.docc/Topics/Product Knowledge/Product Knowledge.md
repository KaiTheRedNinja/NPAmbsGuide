### Common Entry Programmes

Common entry programmes (CEPs) are for students who
- âœ… want to persue poly
- âœ… sure of which industry they want to go into
- ðŸ¤· unsure about specific course

They are:
- Common Business Programme
- Common Media Programme
- Common Science Programme
- Common ICT Programme
- Common Engineering Programme

After Y1S2, they choose which course to take. ALL Y1 STUDENTS IN EACH SCHOOL TAKE THE SAME MODULES.
You will NOT BE "BEHIND".

@Small {
    Exception being LSCT, where only 2 diplomas are available for CEP
}

Benefits of CEP:
- Time and space to explore interests + deeper skills
- Learn foundational modules, taster of each course
- Clear & better informed about diploma courses

PLUS: "Second chance" into preferred course if was highly competitive and did not make it first try

> Important: CEPs are NOT diplomas!!!
