My personal mind-palace-based method for remembering ambs PK

## Overview

A mind palace is a way to remember information by associating it with locations.
Ambs PK is uniquely suited for this because it literally has to do with locations.

I am not familiar enough with some schools to use their buildings as mind palace landmarks, so
I substitute them with things that I myself am familiar with. If you're using this as a guide,
come up with your own replacements.

Stuff I need to remember:

- 8x Academic Schools, for each:
    - Name
    - Bragging (eg. uni admission rates)
    - Learning method (eg. Hands-on/customisable/human-centric)
    - Facilities
    - Industry connections (eg. scholarships, internships, uni pathways)
- 41x Courses, for each:
    - Name
    - Pitch (who should go for it)
    - What is Taught
    - Unique points, if any (eg. “only course that _”)
    - Industry attachments, if any (eg. internships, capstones, uni pathways)
    - Specialisations/pathways/electives, if any
    - 2x Career Prospects
- Admissions methods
    - JAE + EAE, importantly when they take place
    - Full Subject Based Banding
        - Minimum requirements for poly (4xG3 + 1G2)
- NP Selling Points
    - PLP (4x pathways, 12x minors)
    - 8x Go Flex methods
    - Budding Entrepreneurs (GEIP, BYOB, AGILE)
    - CCAs (4x categories)
    - Overseas Exposure (GEIP, OIP, YEP)
- Campus Tour locations

## Academic Schools and Courses

For academic schools, I try and remember the selling points of each course along with its
common entry programme, because it tends to be the lightest details-wise.

Some courses will be in a different order than how they appear in their dedicated notes, or
be in a different location than where their classes are actually held. This is because I can't
be bothered to find their actual location, or it helps me remember them better in a different order.
