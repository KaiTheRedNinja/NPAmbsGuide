Places around campus and whats interesting about them

## Overview

### Facilities

Mention/market whatever you see! BUT MAKE SURE ITS FACTUAL.

When doing campus tours, try to:
- Avoid "empty spaces", try and strike up conversation or point out random things to fill silence
- Use personal stories (eg. "I study here"), or cite "a friend" if you don't personally have experience
- Point out whatever you see
- Use proper names instead of acronyms
