In case parents/students ask about how to join NP

## Overview

There are two main ways to join NP: JAE or EAE

## Joint Admissions Exercise (JAE)

- In Jan
- 6 days after O-level results release
- For O level holders
- Online application has 12 choices

Best way to choose your 12 choices:
- 4x Passion: What you want to do (cutoff irrelevant)
- 4x Practical: What you could feasibly do (ELR2B2 near past cutoff)
- 4x Prudent: What you definetely can do (ELR2B2 well below past cutoff)

## Early Admissions Exercise (EAE)

- Mid june (ITE) or Late june (O levels)
- Up to 3 courses
- Aptitude-based admissions process
- Students receive conditional offers for admission before they receive their final examination results
- After accepting, their place in NP is reserved
- ~20% of admission is through these

## Full Subject Based Banding

Affects 2025 Secondary 2 students (generally, born 2011 or later) taking their national exams in 2027
- There are 3 types of subjects, G1, G2, G3
    - G3, G2, G1 is very similar to H3, H2, H1 in JCs, where higher numbers are more difficult
    - G3 is the equivalent of the "old" system, almost all sec school students will be taking G3
    - Lower G levels are equivalent to "lower" systems

For polytechnic applications, they need:
- AT LEAST 4G3 + 1G2
- ELR2B2 ≤ 22 (previously ≤ 26)
    - Which G-level each subject is usually doesn't matter unless the course has specific requirements (eg. G2 math)

For polytechnic foundation programme (PFP) students, they need:
- 5xG2
- ELMAB3 ≤ 12 (English, Math, Best 3)

The grades are mapped like this:
